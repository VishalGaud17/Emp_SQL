# Employee Database Management (SQL)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on efficiently managing employee data using SQL. It includes schema creation, data insertion, querying, and deletion to analyze workforce trends, salary distribution, hiring patterns, and department-wise performance.

## 📂 Project Structure
The project is organized into separate SQL scripts:
- **Schema_Creation.sql** – Defines tables for Employees, Departments, Salaries, and Promotions.
- **Data_Inserting.sql** – Inserts sample employee records and related data.
- **Emp_Query.sql** – Contains SQL queries for workforce analysis.
- **Delete_Drop.sql** – Handles data deletion and table drop operations.

## 📊 Key Features
- **Database Schema Design**: Structured schema for efficient data storage and retrieval.
- **Data Analysis**: SQL queries to extract insights on salary trends, hiring patterns, and department performance.
- **Staging Table Implementation**: Ensures raw data preservation while enabling transformations.
- **SQL Views**: Predefined views for quick access to department-specific and location-based employee data.

## 📜 SQL Operations Used
- `CREATE TABLE` for database structure
- `INSERT INTO` for populating data
- `SELECT` queries for analysis
- `UPDATE` for modifying records
- `DELETE` for data removal
- `DROP TABLE` for schema cleanup

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Database**: SQL (MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQL Server)
- **Tools**: SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), MySQL Workbench, or any SQL client

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Run `Schema_Creation.sql` to create tables.
2. Execute `Data_Inserting.sql` to insert sample records.
3. Use `Emp_Query.sql` to analyze employee data.
4. Run `Delete_Drop.sql` for cleanup operations if needed.

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset consists of sample employee details, department information, salary history, and promotions.

## 📈 Insights & Analysis
- Identify salary distribution across departments.
- Track employee hiring trends over the years.
- Analyze promotion history based on performance.
- Retrieve department-specific workforce data.

## 📢 Contribution
